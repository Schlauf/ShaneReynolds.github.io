            <h3>Masters Research Project</h3>
            <p>
			This is my project I have been working on for my masters degree. 
			It is a remote therapy platform that takes place inside of a virtual world. 
			I am currently the head of this project and developing and doing a study on the world and its effectiveness for remote therapy. 
			The project is advised by my professor Wesley Deneke and I recieve help developing from multiple undergraduates. 
			It is a unity project and requires virtual world design knowledge along with unity experience and C# experience.
